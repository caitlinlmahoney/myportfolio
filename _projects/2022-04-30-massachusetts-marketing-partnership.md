<b>The Ask:</b> The Massachusetts Marketing Partnership was created in 2010 in an effort to coordinate marketing initiatives on behalf of the Commonwealth. When the partnership was formed, it stated in the by-laws that an official seal had to be designed to represent the new organization. As a secondary request, the new seal was asked to be applied to various print pieces for official communications and mailings.

<b>The Process:</b> Before starting the design process for the Massachusetts Marketing Partnership logo, I was provided the by-laws that stated what had to be incorporated into the artwork. It included guidelines such as including two concentric circles, the state emblem, the color palette, and the establishment date. The challenge was to come up with a design solution that not only met the guidelines but made the logo appear easily legible and distinctive while still being visually connected to other Massachusetts emblems. The final logo went through several iterations that included client feedback until a solution was approved by all organization members. Once full approval was received, the logo was applied to print pieces such as a decal, letterhead, envelope, and business card.


<b>The Solution:</b> The final logo for the Massachusetts Marketing Partnership was well-received by all organization members, and itâ€™s still used today. When designing the logo, clear guidelines had to be followed, but the final product still felt unique while being visually consistent with other state emblems.
