<B>The Ask:</B> Commonwealth Financial Network’s Field Development team sends out physical mailers to potential prospective advisors several times a year. The goal is to keep Commonwealth at the top of mind when an advisor chooses to discuss switching broker-dealers. The mailers are typically delivered in a three-dimensional box that contains an item, a note from the recruiting team, and a custom design representative of the theme.

<B>The Process:</B> During a kickoff meeting, the client requested that a balsa glider be mailed to potential advisors as part of the company’s efforts to recruit wirehouse advisors. The team wanted the box to look professional and display an element of fun, which speaks to Commonwealth’s culture.

The design work was then transferred to me based on an approved concept provided by a senior graphic designer. I worked with a creative director, copywriter, vendor, and project manager on the mailer. While executing the design, I built upon the provided concept to ensure that the artwork aligned with the messaging and Commonwealth’s new visual branding. This was done by including thin line vector illustrations offset with bold brand elements such as the rays. The use of color is also heavily reliant on two core brand colors, which was intentionally selected based on the audience and item.

When finalizing the interior and exterior of the box design, I also worked with a vendor on the print specifications, which included everything from the material, color setup, die lines, postage requirements, and the final wrapping.

<B>The Solution:</B> Overall, the project was on time, on budget, and was representative of the Commonwealth brand. The final package was also well received by the client, and it set the groundwork for what package design could look like for item-specific mailers in the future.
