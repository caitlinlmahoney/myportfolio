<B>The Ask:</b> In 2019, Commonwealth Financial Network held its annual educational Vista Club conference in Colorado Springs. Attendees included selected advisors and industry partners. The four-day event needed branding created and executed on all digital and print event materials.

<B>The Process:</b> Acting as the lead designer, my first course of action was to sit down with several colleagues on the Conferences and Events team to gather pertinent information regarding the four-day event. During the meeting, I learned what was essential to explore, highlight, and incorporate into the design. Following the meeting, I continued to do more research and created three concepts which were then presented to the client. We continued to work together to incorporate feedback until the final branding was finalized. The conference branding was applied to a wide range of marketing materials which included but were not limited to a website, mobile application, name badges, signage, presentations, apparel, and handouts.

<B>The Solution:</b> The final branding was successfully applied to all materials on time and within budget. The design was unique to the conference while representative of the area and architecture. It allowed for a clean, distinctive, and professional appearance that made the four-day event feel customized to the attendees, enhancing the overall experience.
