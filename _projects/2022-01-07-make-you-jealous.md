In qua quid est boni praeter summam voluptatem, et eam sempiternam? Cur post Tarentum ad Archytam? Qua ex cognitione facilior facta est investigatio rerumano occultissimarum. Negat enim tenuissimo victu, id est contemptissimis escis et sed potionibus, minorem voluptatem. Ego quoque, inquit, didicerim libentius si table quiduse proactive domination.

The Ask: The Massachusetts Marketing Partnership was created in 2010 to coordinate marketing efforts on behalf of the Commonwealth. When the partnership was formed, it stated in the by-laws that an official seal had to be designed to represent the new organization. As a secondary request, it was asked that the new seal be applied to a variety of print pieces for official communications and mailings. 

The Process: Before starting the design process for the Massachusetts Marketing Partnership logo, I was provided the by-laws that stated what had to be incorporated into the artwork. It included guidelines such as including two concentric circles, the state emblem, colors, and the establishment date. The challenge was to come up with a design solution that not only met the guidelines but made the logo appear easily legible and distinctive, while still being visually connected to other Massachusetts emblems. The final logo went through several iterations, that included client feedback until a solution was approved by all members of the organization. Once full approval was received the logo was then applied to a range of print pieces such as a decal, letterhead, envelope, and business card. 

The Solution: The final logo for the Massachusetts Marketing Partnership successfully included all elements, and was constructed in a way that appears intentional. It was well received and is still used to represent the organization.
