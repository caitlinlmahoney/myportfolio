<b>The Ask:</b> Corporate Social Responsibility is a large part of Commonwealth Financial Network’s identity. The leadership team wanted to communicate that more formally via its first annual CSR Report. 

<b>The Process:</b> The CSR report began with an initial kickoff meeting that included all individuals and departments involved in the request. Upon further discussion, we all agreed there was an opportunity to do more than just create a report. The decision was made to promote the document both internally and externally. This resulted in additional design requests, including social graphics and a web page.

Before starting the design process, I researched what other financial firms have created for their reports to better understand what was successful. I worked with a marketing copywriter and art director to design a piece that presented the information in a way that was easily digestible, engaging and representative of the Commonwealth brand. Since Commonwealth’s visual branding was still evolving, there was no similar document. The challenge was to push the boundaries of the company’s traditional brochure setup while weaving in stock imagery with employee photos, iconography, and brand elements that had not been heavily explored up to this point.

Following the report design, both the external web page and social graphics had to be designed. When creating the web page, I worked alongside a visual designer to determine a layout that allowed for design elements from the report to be incorporated while keeping with the visual branding of the website. A similar approach was taken when creating social posts. Working alongside a copywriter, we had to stay true to the generic template while incorporating design elements that were pulled from the report and unique to the presented topic.

<b>The Solution:</b> A design solution was created that was able to span a digital PDF report, social ads, and a web page. All touchpoints incorporated design elements exclusive to the report while reinforcing the Commonwealth visual branding.
