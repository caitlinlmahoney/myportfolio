<b>The Ask:</b> Commonwealth Financial Network began a new initiative to recruit wirehouse advisors. To support the initiative, informational marketing materials had to be created for a printed marketing kit, including a bi-fold brochure titled “From A to Fee: The Path to Your Ideal Advisory Practice.”

<b>The Process:</b> When creating the Glidepath brochure, I worked primarily alongside a marketing writer, creative director, and print vendor. Brochures created in the past were often copy and icon-based, and here the challenge was to make the brochure more personable to those reading the document. The brochure also had to be representative of the company’s new branding efforts, which were still being defined.

Through doing exploratory work and having consistent design meetings, we defined and provided guidelines on how to make the brochure more personable. It was ultimately decided that photography would be heavily incorporated into the layout in conjunction with Commonwealth’s new voice, brand elements, type treatment, and color palette. Until this point, the company had limited in-house imagery, so pictures had to be sourced that spoke to the subject matter and followed the brand’s photography guidelines. This ultimately allowed for a more powerful visual message to be communicated that appeared cohesive.

<b>The Solution:</b> The final printed brochure showcased what Commonwealth offers in a new fresh manner that pushed past a traditional type and icon-based template. Finding ways to heavily incorporate photography with brand elements alongside the copy allowed for a more personable approach. The brochure design also laid the groundwork for what can be created for future marketing materials related to recruiting wirehouse advisors.
