<b>The Ask:</B> The Princeton Review is an educational services company that sells test preparation courses and materials. The Princeton Review created an application that clients could use to study for the MCAT test on their phones, tablet, and computer. A portion of the project included designing an app icon that could be carried across the app store, smartphone, desktop icons, and splash screens.

<b>The Process:</B> Before concepting began for the app icon design, I first looked at what had been previously created for other test types under the Princeton Review. I discovered that every design was treated differently, and the branding was not consistent. To allow for greater brand consistency moving forward, I created a template that utilized the same layout, typography, and color scheme but allowed the test type and graphic to be customized. In addition to the design being treated differently, I also noticed the hierarchy was inconsistent. For this reason, I formatted the template so that the visual hierarchy focused on the company name followed by the test type. With the approval of this approach, I was able to apply the MCAT icon and copy changes to the app icon and splash screens in a clean design that was easily legible when scaled at any size.

<b>The Solution:</B> The icon app design was successfully applied and formatted for the app store, smartphone, desktop icons, and splash screens. The final solution allowed for a more professional approach that was reflective of the company's branding efforts, as seen in other materials that were pushed out to clients.
