I’m a Massachusetts-based graphic designer with ten years of experience in marketing, print, branding, and digital design. I provide creative on-brand design solutions informed by data, the audience, and overarching strategy. I believe that design is constantly evolving, so it’s essential to stay current on trends and best practices when implementing design decisions for every project. When I’m not designing, you’ll find me working on my next art piece, searching for a new show to binge-watch, and spending time with my family. 

I’m always looking for new opportunities to work on creative projects. If you’re interested in collaborating, please reach out at <a href="mailto:caitlinlmahoney@gmail.com">caitlinlmahoney@gmail.com</a>.
